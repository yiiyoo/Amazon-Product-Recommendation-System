Recommendation Systems Learner Notebook

This project is a comprehensive learner-friendly notebook designed to explore, implement, and understand different Recommendation System techniques. It serves both as an educational guide and as a hands-on coding reference.

Covers basic to advanced recommendation techniques.

Implementations of:

- Popularity-based recommendations
- Collaborative filtering (User-based & Item-based)
- Matrix Factorization methods (SVD)
- Content-based filtering
- Hybrid approaches
- Includes data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and visualization.
- End-to-end code, from dataset loading to performance evaluation.

Requirements

- Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed with the following libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn surprise


(Optional for visualization/EDA):

- pip install jupyter notebook

How to Use:

- Clone this repository or download the notebook.
- Install the dependencies.
- Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode.
- Run through the sections sequentially to learn and test different recommender system techniques.

Evaluation Metrics Implemented

- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Precision, Recall (for top-N recommendation tasks)

Learning Outcomes

- By working through this notebook, you will:
- Understand the core concepts behind recommendation engines.
- Be able to implement classical recommendation models from scratch.
- Gain hands-on experience with libraries like scikit-learn and Surprise.
- Learn how to compare model performance and tune hyperparameters.

This notebook was created as a learning project on recommendation systems. Contributions, improvements, and suggestions are welcome!

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand recommender systems or an intermediate learner revising your concepts, this notebook serves as a complete resource.
